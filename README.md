# network_attacks_simulation_and_detection
**Project Objective**

To simulate network attacks like port scanning, brute force, DOS and spoofing using various tools then detection and analysis of attacks with Wireshark.

Started traffic capture on a WLAN then launched attacks on other hosts in the network followed by analysing the .pcap file on Wireshark.

The .pcapng file is provided in this repository.
