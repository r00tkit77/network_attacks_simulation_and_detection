# network_attacks_simulation_and_detection
Simulating network attacks like port scanning, brute force, DOS and spoofing using various tools then detection and analysis of attacks with Wireshark.
Started traffic capture on a WLAN then launched attacks on other hosts in the network followed by analysing the .pcap file on Wireshark.
Did this as a cyber security project.
The .pcap file is provided in this repository.

DISCLAIMER: This project is for **educational purposes only**. All attacks were performed in a controlled lab environment on devices I own. Never use these techniques on unauthorized networks or systems.
